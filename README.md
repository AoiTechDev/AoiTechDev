<p align="left">After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I had to decide on my career path. Front-end development has consistently held my interest, emerging as my area of greatest familiarity subsequent to my formal education and technical training. I challenged myself to code and learn every day, committed to continuous improvement. This dedication builds discipline and brings me great joy. I am fully committed to becoming an expert in this field and I am confident that I will succeed.</p>


<h2 align="left">üöÄCurrently Projects I am working on:</h2>

- üç± **Mealfulness** - An application designed to streamline the tracking of daily macros and meals. This is my primary focus app now where I put the most effort in it.

- üéß **WiredWave** - Ecommerce store with Headphones.
